# SwiftUI-WeatherApp
Just a super basic iOS application built using SwiftUI, Apple's latest UI framework to learn more about it!
<br>
**Concepts that I learned by developing this app:**
*Understanding XCode and its environment.
*Creating and starting a new project in SwiftUI
*Basics of SwiftUI such as VStacks, HStacks, ZStacks and lots of different views such as Images, Buttons, Spacers and custom subviews.
*Using different modifiers for these views.
*Creating different states and changing them with a button
*Using SF Symbols.
*Using built-in and custom gradients and colors.

Overall, I understood the basics of SwiftUI and how an application is created in XCode. This application was developed from Sean Allen's YouTube video. I'm referencing his videos for learning iOS dev. Looking forwards to learn more in-depth data-passing and app dev. Cheers! Here's the app üëáüèº
